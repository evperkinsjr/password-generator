# Password Generator

## Description

This application randomly generates a password based on user inputs. I accomplished this by:
1. Adding a "click" event listener, so the functions initiate when user clicks the "Generate Password" button.
2. Creating character variables for the computer to choose from.
3. Prompting the user to choose password length and character types.
4. Checking if user chose a length 8-128 characters long and at least one character type.
5. Combining user inputs into a password string.
6. Passing the newly created password into the text area of the HTML for the user to see.
7. Making the sure the application mobile-responsive.
